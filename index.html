        <h1>Web Design for Everyone Final Page</h1>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>This course was super helpful to get an understanding of the basics of HTML and where to get started.</p>
        <h2>Learnings Ahead</h2>
            <p>Here's to lots more learning about what I'll be able to explore and replicate, revise and make my own. Here are some thoughts about where I can start:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm looking forward to getting to understand how repositories work further so that I can access my own website's code to review and rework on my own.</li>
                <li>I know I have a lot more to learn about HTML, and especially CSS for styling, but I'll be able to learn by understanding how my own website is built on a foundational level.</li>
                <li>My website is built on lots of javascript, so that will be next to learn.</li>
            </ul>
